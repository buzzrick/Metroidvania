# Metroidvania Todos and Nots

## Story

 - washed up on beach.
 - Expand to island village : "Cursed Village"
 - NPCs are frozen to stone - require MacGuffin to free each villager

## Todo

Tool Upgrades
Swimming fatigue and reset
better camera angle handling
colorized Gameobjects in heirarchy (eg: color or icon for UnlockNodes)


## Bugs

 - Popups persist after resource is harvested
 - Touch move sometimes keeps moving after touch release


# Future thoughts


Add "Cinematic bars" to top/bottom of the screen when cutscene camera running.

Crab Island to the South East 
Grab the "Ropeweaver" soul from a skittish crab
Turn Rope machine into Kira the Ropeweaver 

# weapons

Can start with a club
Carpenter can create it.

NPCs - Add question mark UI element to talk to NPC 
	eg: Ropeweaver
			"Thank you for saving me"
			"I'm Kira the Ropeweaver"
			"Bring me wiregrass and I can make rope for you" (this could be generalised with input/output resource SOs?)
